## Background
West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral illness largely spread by mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito bites them.The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city. They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.
